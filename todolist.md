## Brownian motion
- single trait, single sample (HQ)
- multiple traits, single sample (HQ)
- multiple traits, multiple samples (HQ)
- multiple correlated traits

## OU
- single trait, single sample (PL)
- multiple traits, single sample (PL)
- multiple traits, multiple samples (PL)
- multiple correlated traits

## State dependent models
- Don't include it for now

## Likelhood type
- REML
- Standard <-- we use this

## Likelihood algorithm
- Generalized least squares
- Pruning (FitzJohn)

We implement both for validation, use pruning for the real analysis.


Goals: likelihood

criteria: use the given tree with ape format
